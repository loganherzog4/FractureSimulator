# FractureSimulator
Fracture Simulator project built for my 2017 internship as a Petroleum Engineer.


This project was developed without much regard to code maintainability - it was meant to be used entirely internally for our small team of Reservoir Engineers. Therefore, if you notice that I declared variables at the top of subs in massive walls, and that the majority of algorithm mathematics is not commented over...sorry!


I have developed much better coding practices since I made this project; however, it still does exactly what it was designed to do, and was a project that got me hired on for a second internship.


In order to demo the functionality, follow these steps:


1) Download Fracture Simulator.xlsm, Wood.las, and Directional Survey.txt from this repository
2) Open Fracture Simulator.xlsm and enable macros
3) Click the top button, "Run Simulation"
4) A form should pop up. Click the three dots button next to the text field to open a File Explorer window
5) Navigate to where you saved WOOD.las and double click that file to select it
6)
